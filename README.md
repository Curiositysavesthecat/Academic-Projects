Hello Everyone :)
I will be adding all the projects I build while learning Data Science  and their HUGE-Massive not at all necessary  descriptions on the go.
1. Drowsiness Detector
   Whether you use this for making sure your kids don't fall asleep or the driver you employed , this is a very cool application of a computer vision model.
   A detailed description of the project is given in the README file of the folder named "Drowsiness Detector".
